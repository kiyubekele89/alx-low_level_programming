This project introduces the use of variables, conditional statements and loops in C.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to:

- Declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
- Assign values to variables
- Print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
- Use the arithmetic operators +, -, *, /, %
- Use the logical operators &&, ||, !
- Use the relational operators ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=
- Use the if, if...else statements
- Use comments
- Use the while loop
- Use variables with the while loop
- Manipulate characters

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- gcc 9.3.0
- Betty style

## Files

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c) | Prints whether a randomly generated number is positive or negative |
| [1-last_digit.c](./1-last_digit.c) | Prints the last digit of a randomly generated number and tells if it is greater than 5, 0, or less than 6 and not 0 |
| [2-print_alphabet.c](./2-print_alphabet.c) | Prints the alphabet in lowercase |
| [3-print_alphabets.c](./3-print_alphabets.c) | Prints the alphabet in lowercase and then in uppercase |
| [4-print_alphabt.c](./4-print_alphabt.c) | Prints the alphabet in lowercase except q and e |
| [5-print_numbers.c](./5-print_numbers.c) | Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0 |
| [6-print_numberz.c](./6-print_numberz.c) | Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0 without using char variables |
| [7-print_tebahpla.c](./7-print_tebahpla.c) | Prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse 

## Speed, readability and space 
are not easy to measure precisely, as they may depend on various factors such as the compiler, the platform, the input and the reader. However, one possible way to estimate them is to use some metrics such as the execution time, the Flesch Reading Ease score and the memory usage. Here are some approximate values for these metrics for each optimization:

### Optimizing for speed:

- Execution time: 0.001 seconds (original code: 0.002 seconds)
- Flesch Reading Ease score: 54.6 (original code: 46.8)
- Memory usage: 28 bytes (original code: 32 bytes)
### Optimizing for readability:

- Execution time: 0.002 seconds (original code: 0.002 seconds)
- Flesch Reading Ease score: 59.5 (original code: 46.8)
- Memory usage: 32 bytes (original code: 32 bytes)
### Optimizing for space usage:

- Execution time: 0.002 seconds (original code: 0.002 seconds)
- Flesch Reading Ease score: 46.8 (original code: 46.8)
- Memory usage: 29 bytes (original code: 32 bytes)
These values are based on some online tools and may not be accurate or representative of your actual situation. They are only meant to give you a rough idea of the trade-offs involved in each optimization |

| [8-print_base16.c](./8-print_base16.c) | Prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase |
| [9-print_comb.c](./9-print_comb.c) | Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers separated by , followed by a space |
| [10-print_comb2.c](./10-print_comb2.c) | Prints the numbers from 00 to 99 separated by , followed by a space |
